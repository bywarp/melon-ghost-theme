# Melon Ghost Theme

![version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-2573bc)

This repository contains a complete Ghost v3 theme used on the (now abandoned) Melon Games news website.

## Preamble

This Ghost theme was originally created for use on the Melon Games news page, however the site was decommissioned shortly after Melon Games was shut down in early 2021. Thus, this repository has been made public in the hope that it may be useful to someone else.

## Installation

Install this theme using the Ghost administration panel, more information can be found [here](https://ghost.org/help/installing-a-theme/).
